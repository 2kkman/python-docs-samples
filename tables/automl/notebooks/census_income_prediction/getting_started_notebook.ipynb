When the deployment code `response = client.deploy_model(model_name=model.name)` finishes, you will be able to see this on the UI. Check the [UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/automl-tables?_ga=2.255483016.-1079099924.1550856636) and navigate to the predict tab of your model, and then to the online prediction portion, to see when it finishes online deployment before running the prediction cell.You should see \"online prediction\" text near the top, click on it, and it will take you to a view of your online prediction interface. You should see \"model deployed\" on the far right of the screen if the model is deployed, or a \"deploying model\" message if it is still deploying. </span>"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"t3b-fUQMnXI0","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["tables_client.deploy_model(model=model).result()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jDxcqNl8oLuo","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Verify if model has been deployed, check deployment_state field, it should show: DEPLOYED"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ln-ptzgWoMbF","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["model = tables_client.get_model(model_name=model_name)\n","model"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZzVMSahBoVKb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Run the prediction, only after the model finishes deployment"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oHBcyEbZoj98","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Make an Online prediction**\n","\n","You can toggle exactly which values you want for all of the numeric features, and choose from the drop down windows which values you want for the categorical features.\n","\n","Note: If the model has not finished deployment, the prediction will NOT work.
